# HEARTH

Easily manage what will be loaded in your shell environment

## Installation

Clone project and source hearth.sh in .*rc, e.g. .bashrc file.

## Directory Structure

Functionality is divided in

* env
* paths
* aliases
* functions

For each functionality we have a folder with configurable scripts and a file that will always be loaded.

For example for env we have the env.d directory and env.sh script.

Each *.d directory has three sub-folders

* available
* secret
* enabled

Every symbolic link in enabled directory will be sourced on start up. In available we have recipes that will be committed to repository.
In secret you can add anything that must be excluded from the repository like tokens.
